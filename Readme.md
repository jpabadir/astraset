When we go to astaset.com/TSLA, we see charts, like how it was with hypercharts with net income, number of stores, number of cars produced, etc. 

So, in our DB, we need to store all the stuff we want to render when we access that. 

We could even have some manual plugging as well. 

Like for instance, can we get the annual number of cars produced with code? If not, we can probably just add it manually. 

Maybe we can use chatgpt to find data that's not super well structured? 

I might even be able to just use google api to make a google search: "How many cars did Tesla deliver in Q1 2020?" and then I just use the number they give me, it'll be correct.
